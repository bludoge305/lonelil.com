# How I got scammed out of $660 on GitHub Sponsors

Before I start, I didn't lose any money out of pocket.

It all started when my GitHub Organization was approved for Github Sponsors on the Second of July, 2022, I thought nothing of it and didn't expect anyone to donate.

Two days later, I randomly got an email from GitHub saying I have reached my GitHub Sponsors goal of $50 per month. It was strange because we didn't have any public repositorys and the project was not even public yet.

A day later, I got another email saying I have got an **$600.00 / year**.

I was confused at this point, but I thought it might be just a scam and ignored it.

Glad I did, not even a day later the account has been deleted and there is no trace of him on the internet.

And for people asking why I didn't withdraw the money when I got the donation, you have to wait 90 days for your first withdrawal.
